Logistic Model Building using Stats Model &amp; RFE

# Problem statement:
X Education sells online courses and needs a solution that can increase their customer lead conversions. The focus is selection of the most promising leads, i.e., the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.
The company needs a model wherein a lead score is assigned to each of the customer leads. The high score value would denote a high conversion chance of the prospect customer while lower score value means lower conversion chance.
The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
